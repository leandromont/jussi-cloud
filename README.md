# Jüssi Cloud
The idea of Jüssi Cloud is to build an application to save all assets links inside a single place, separating by working area.

## Developing
To run the project, we need to have `node` installed. If you already have node installed, it's just run the command `npm i`.

After installing all project dependencies, you only need to run `gulp` on your terminal.

This will setup a local server with livereload on your files.
